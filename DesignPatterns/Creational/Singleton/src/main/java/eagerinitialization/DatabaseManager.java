/**
 * In eager initialization, the instance of the singleton class is created at the time of class loading.
 * The drawback to eager initialization is that the instance is created even though the client application
 * might not be using it.
 *
 * If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to use.
 * But in most of the scenarios, singleton classes are created for resources such as
 * File System, Database connections, etc.
 *
 * We should avoid the instantiation unless the client calls the getInstance method.
 * Also, this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
